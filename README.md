# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
  - I begin by revieiwing the project reading through all iterations so I can have a direction of where I am going. This helps clear up any confusion of what the objective is. I then always begin with test and review them to see if and when I shoud split them up in different describe blocks. I go line for line and pass every test although sometimes I will look ahead to try and set myself up to create a more effecient method for my tests.
  
2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
    - The hardest part was trouble shooting but I find this helpuful to experience. This allows me to be familiar with failures and errors and how I can correct them. 
  
3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
    - What was hard in the begining was changing the variables especially if they were in a hash. What was easy was the information given to us and once I was done with the first database at the end of iteration 2 it was easy to follow those steps to work through iteration 3. I am not to familiar with JSON but when I reached out to my peers for assistance it ran smoothly afterwarrds.
